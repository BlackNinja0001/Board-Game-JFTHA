Congratulations, adventurer! You are about to embark on a quest for something that peasants can only dream about.

Many others also want this ancient antique for themselves, desiring unworldly things such as immortality. There also will be many items along the way that will help, or hinder, your progress towards everyoneâ€™s dream. You have the opportunity; now take it and venture forth!
	
How To Run:
*Note: We used Netbeans 7.4 or later to create this project. Therefore, we strongly recommend using that version of Netbeans or later. Any previous versions or other IDES may have build problems we cannot currently help with. Apologies in advance.\n*
*1. Clone in your preferred IDE.\n*
*2. Build the project.\n*
*3. Run either Intro.java or NumberOfPlayers.java\n*
*4. Fill in the number of players.\n*
*5. Fill in tne names and classes of players.*
*6. Play the game. Keep in mind that currently this part of the program still needs a lot of work. It auto-rolls the die so the first thing you should see is the Store menu.*
